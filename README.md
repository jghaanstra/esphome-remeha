# ESPHome Remeha / Dietrich external component

Native ESPHome external component for reading out the values of Remeha / De Dietrich central heating boilers.

Based on [kakaki/esphome_dietrich](https://github.com/kakaki/esphome_dietrich), rewritten by Claude Sonnet 4.6 as a proper ESPHome *external component* to work with **ESPHome 2025.2+** (including 2026.x), where `platform: custom` and the `includes:` hook were removed. Supplied as is, use at your own risk.

## Background

| ESPHome version | Status |
|---|---|
| ≤ 2025.1 | `platform: custom` + `includes:` works |
| 2025.2 | `platform: custom` removed; workaround via [robertklep/esphome-custom-component](https://github.com/robertklep/esphome-custom-component) |
| 2026.3+ | The workaround no longer works either; a native external component is required |

This repository solves the problem structurally: the logic has been converted to a proper ESPHome component with Python code generation.

## Requirements

- ESPHome 2025.2 or higher
- ESP8266 (e.g. NodeMCU v2) or ESP32
- UART connection to the boiler at 9600 baud, 8N1

## Connection schema
```
 Heater Board from top       ESP8266
    4P4C RJ connector
    
       +---------+
GND 4  ---       +--+        GND (GND)
TXD 3  ---          |        RX (GPIO13 / D7)
RXD 2  ---          |        TX (GPIO15 / D8)
5V  1  ---       +--+        5V (VIN)
       +---------+
```


## Installation

### 1. Add the external component to your YAML

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://jghaanstra/esphome-remeha
    components: [remeha]
```

### 2. Define the UART bus

```yaml
uart:
  id: uart_bus
  baud_rate: 9600
  tx_pin: GPIO15
  rx_pin: GPIO13
  stop_bits: 1
```

### 3. Add the boiler hub

```yaml
remeha:
  id: remeha_component
  uart_id: uart_bus
  update_interval: 15s    # optional, default 15s
```

### 4. Configure sensors

All sensors are optional. Only add the sensors you need:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: remeha
    remeha_id: remeha_component
    flow_temp:
      name: "Boiler flow temperature"
    return_temp:
      name: "Boiler return temperature"
    boiler_state:
      name: "Boiler state (numeric)"
    # ... see example-cv-ketel.yaml for all available sensors
```

See [example-cv-ketel.yaml](example-cv-ketel.yaml) for a complete configuration including text sensors for human-readable state descriptions.

## Migrating from the old custom component configuration

1. Remove `includes: [cv-ketel.h]` from the `esphome:` section
2. Remove the `external_components` entry for `robertklep/esphome-custom-component`
3. Remove the `platform: custom` sensor block with the lambda
4. Add the new `remeha:` hub and `platform: remeha` sensors as described above
